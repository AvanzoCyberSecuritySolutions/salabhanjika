      <h2>Bhamakalapam</h2>
      <p>
        The script of this presentation has a variety of interpretations by different exponents. 
        But the most important and familiar one is the script written by Sri Sidhendra Yogi. 
        No chronological or time framed explanation about the different script are available. 
        In the absence of manuscript by Sri Sidhendra Yogi much re-reprints are in circulation. 
        Even though there are no difference in basic idea in all these scripts, the style of 
        presentation is different from one another. Bhamakalapam presented by Saalabhanjika is 
        the result of research by Saalabhanjika team and Cyber Crime Investigator Dr. Pattathil 
        Dhanya Menon on 7 different scripts and also after detailed discussion and interactions 
        with elderly Gurus in the field. The choreography of Bhamakalapam presented by Saalabhanjika 
        is done by Pattathil Dhanya Menon with the advice and direction of Kalathapaswi Guru Ramavani Sundari.

      <h2>Ardhanareeswaram</h2>
      <p>In the Hindu Iconography Ardhanareeswaram is depicted as half male and half female,
         evently down the middle upon a central axis. This hindu deity is Symbolizes the inseparability  
         of feminine aspect of the divine, with the male principle of God. This is one of the very important
          form of God in Hindu worship. Hindus believe that the God is male, female and neuter too. Since God 
          is conveptuallu beyond sex, though reffered as he/she many time, itis more appropriate to be reffered 
          as it especially as 
        its intrinsic condition as to many Hindu scriptures. This is an adaption from pagattivesha popular in Andra.</p>
